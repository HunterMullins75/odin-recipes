        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> With this ravioli recipe you can make a four-cheese
            filling or meat filling.
    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cupes all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li> Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of semolina flour, more for dusting</li>
        <li>2 extra-large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
        </li>
        <li> </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol> <li> <p>In a food processor, pulse the flour with the salt, 
        nutmeg and the 1 tablespoon of semolina. Add the eggs 
        and pulse until incorporated.</p> <p>With the machine on, add 
        the olive oil in a thin stream and process just until 
        moistened crumbs form. Turn the crumbs out onto a 
        semolina-dusted work surface and knead just until a 
        smooth dough forms. Wrap the dough in plastic and let 
        stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.</p>
    </li>
        <li> <p>Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces and cover with 
            plastic wrap. Work with 1 piece at a time: Flatten 
            the dough into a 5-by-4-inch oval, about 1/2 inch 
            thick. Dust lightly with semolina. Roll the dough 
            through a hand-cranked pasta machine at the widest 
            setting.</p> <p>Fold the dough in thirds (like a letter), 
            then run it through the machine at the same setting, 
            folded edge first. Repeat the folding and rolling once more. 
            Roll the dough through at successively narrower settings, 
            two times per setting, until it is thin enough for you to see 
            the outline of your hand through it. Lay the dough out on a work 
            surface lightly dusted with semolina.</p>
        </li>
    
        <li>Brush any semolina off the dough.</li>
        <li><p>Sun-shaped ravioli: Cut a sheet of dough in half crosswise. On one half, 
            spoon 10 mounded teaspoons of filling in 2 rows of 5, about 3 
            inches apart; cover with the second half. </p> <p>Press out any air around 
            the filling. Using a 2 1/2 - inch round cookie cutter, cut out the 
            ravioli. Make “rays” around the edges with the tines of a fork.</p></li>
        <li>Transfer filled and cut ravioli to a large rimmed baking sheet 
            lightly dusted with semolina. Repeat with the remaining pasta 
            dough and filling.
        </li>
       
        <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook half of the ravioli 
            over high heat until al dente, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted 
            spoon, transfer the ravioli to a platter. Repeat with the remaining 
            ravioli and serve.</li>
